# Safe Naming Practices

The following symbols are reserved for use in infix logic:
- Left parens `(`, right parens `)`, plus `+`, and vertical bar `|` (used for basic operations)
- Less than `<`, equals `=`, and greater than `>` (used for comparison operations)
- Asterisk `*` (used to create reference tokens)
- Question mark `?` (used to create coallescing tokens)
- Forward slash `/` (used for projecting state providers to bool values)
- Additionally, `!` and `` ` `` are used in item strings
- Some symbols are not currently used, but are reserved for future use: 
  `!`, `~`, `\`, `@`, `#`, `%`, `^`, `&`, `.`



The following symbols are safe to include in logic (this list may not be exhaustive):
- Alphanumeric characters
- Underscore `_`
- Hyphen `-`
- Square brackets `[` and `]`
- Curly brackets `{` and `}`
- Apostrophe `'`
- Comma `,`
- Semicolon `;`
- Colon `:`
- Dollar sign `$`

Also, it should be noted that leading and trailing white space is stripped from tokens when an infix expression 
is tokenized. Internal white space should be avoided.

Names which contain illegal symbols can be used to create tokens and logic in code, but will result in infix 
expressions which do not correctly deserialize. Thus, names of terms, macros, and logic variables should not 
use illegal symbols. Names of logic defs are encouraged to avoid illegal symbols, or else they will be unusable 
in reference tokens.
